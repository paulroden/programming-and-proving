Programming and Proving in Agda – Working Notes
======================================================

These are some working notes to [Programming and Proving in Agda](https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-lecture-notes) by Jesper Cockx.

The notes are quite rough for now — reviewing these and writing them up (probably in pretty LaTeX) will be the next step.

**Spoiler alert** these notes contain solutions to the exercises.

**Quality alert** the solutions have not yet been reviewed...

...by a human, at least. Agda has typechecked them and pleasantly coloured in the code. Therefore, the proofs can be considered valid. Which is rather neat when you think about it.
